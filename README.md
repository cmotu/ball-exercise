# ball-exercise
Description: this exercise was done in my MiT course, and it was a practice on moving objects with js. In this case I created a second object so that there would be two balls moving across the page.
Usage: could be reused to figure out other page animations in future projects.
Support:contact me at cmotu@sandiego.edu
Roadmap: I may extend this project further and create more objects/different movements.
License Information: this is open-source code created by me (Christina Motu) and has no licensing.
